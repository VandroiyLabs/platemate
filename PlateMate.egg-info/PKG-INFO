Description: PlateMate
        ====
        
        PlateMate is a python package that helps you importing and analyzing data from plates with multiple weels (e.g., 96-well plates). The main idea is to construct a package capable of handling the most common tasks needed when analyzing data from multiple-well plates, and fully compatible with Jupyter Notebooks. This is still under development, but if you are interested in using and testing it, feel free to contact us.
        
        It was originally written for the iGEM 2015 competition.
